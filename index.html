                The sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. 
                Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. 
                Without the sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. 
                And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy. 
                If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, the Earth would be the size of a U.S. nickel. 
                The temperature at the sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.

                The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, 
                Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
                From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, 
                and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. 
                Despite its proximity to the Sun, 
                Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, 
                thanks to its dense atmosphere.
                Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation.

                Venus is the second planet from the Sun,

                Venus is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon, 
                and sometimes looks like a bright star in the morning or evening sky. 
                The planet is a little smaller than Earth, and is similar to Earth inside. 
                We can't see the surface of Venus from Earth, because it is covered with thick clouds. 
                However, space missions to Venus have shown us that its surface is covered with craters, 
                volcanoes, mountains, and big lava plains.

                Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. 
                The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life.
                With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, 
                and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. 
                Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. 
                Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, 
                but for at least a thousand years, 
                some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply.

                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. 
                Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, 
                and evidence that it was even more active in the past.
                Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, 
                and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
                NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), 
                and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.

                the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. 
                Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, 
                floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. 
                Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
                Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. 
                Saturn also has dozens of moons.
                From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, 
                the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.

                It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, 
                Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, 
                although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.
                It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, 
                in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. 
                Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III.

                It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. 
                It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. 
                Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. 
                The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, 
                but they're very hard to see.

                collectively referred to as Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), 
                in this distant region of our solar system.
